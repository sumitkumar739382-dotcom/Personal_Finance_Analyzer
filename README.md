# 📊 Personal Finance Analyzer

## 📌 Overview
**Personal Finance Analyzer** is a beginner-friendly Python project that analyzes daily personal expenses using **basic descriptive statistics**.  
The project is designed in alignment with **B.Sc. Statistics Semester I (STAMJ11 – Descriptive Statistics)** and focuses on implementing the **core statistical logic manually**, without using external libraries such as NumPy or Pandas.

The emphasis is on understanding *how statistical formulas are translated into algorithms* rather than producing an optimized or production-level tool.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze daily expenses using **Arithmetic Mean, Median, and Standard Deviation**
- Apply **Measures of Dispersion** to study variability in spending
- Strengthen understanding of **loops, conditionals, and functions** in Python
- Build a conceptual base for **statistical computing and data analysis**

---

## 📚 Syllabus Relevance (STAMJ11 – Unit III)
The project is based on the following topics from the syllabus:

### Measures of Central Tendency
- Arithmetic Mean  
- Median  

### Measures of Dispersion
- Variance  
- Standard Deviation  
- Range (to be added later)

All computations are performed using **explicit mathematical formulas**.

## 🛠 Current Implementation
- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries Used:** None (pure Python)  
- **Data Input:** Daily expenses entered manually for a selected month and year  
- **Data Structure:** Dictionary for date-wise expenses, converted to a list for computation  
- **Computation Style:** Step-by-step functional approach  

This version prioritizes **clarity and learning**, not optimization.
